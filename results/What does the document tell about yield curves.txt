Prompt: What does the document tell about yield curves?

Answer: The document suggests that there are different approaches to setting discount rates based on yield curves. One approach is to use the published gilt yield curve, which is commonly used in calculating a defined benefit scheme's technical provisions (TPs). Another approach is to use the "risk-free" yield curve underlying an insurance company's TPs. The document indicates that the former option (setting discount rates relative to gilt yield curve) should be the approach for Superfund liabilities, but with a dynamic approach that includes an allowance for expected out-performance. The document also mentions that legislation and guidance will provide more detailed proposals on how the discount rates will be set to achieve policy objectives.
