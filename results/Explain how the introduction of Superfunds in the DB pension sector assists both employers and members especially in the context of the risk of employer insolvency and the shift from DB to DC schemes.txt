Prompt: Explain how the introduction of Superfunds in the DB pension sector assists both employers and members, especially in the context of the risk of employer insolvency and the shift from DB to DC schemes.

Answer: The introduction of Superfunds in the defined benefit (DB) pension sector provides benefits for both employers and members. For employers, Superfunds offer a solution to manage their legacy liabilities, particularly for smaller companies that may find long-term DB schemes to be a burdensome and unpredictable cost burden. By moving their pension scheme into a Superfund, employers are relieved of their obligations to the scheme, allowing them to focus on their core business and potentially benefiting the wider UK economy.
For members, Superfunds help mitigate the risk of employer insolvency. Even if a DB scheme is fully funded on the "Statutory Funding Objective" basis, there is still a risk that in the event of employer insolvency, there may not be sufficient resources in the scheme to secure full benefits for members with an insurer. Superfunds provide a better prospect of delivering full benefits to members compared to exporting schemes. They offer additional scheme funding, a capital buffer, benefits of scale, and improved governance, all of which increase the probability of members receiving their benefits in full.
Furthermore, the shift from DB to defined contribution (DC) schemes has been a significant trend in the pension sector. Most pension schemes being set up now are DC schemes, while the majority of DB schemes are either closed to new members or further accrual. Superfunds provide an opportunity to take significant risk out of the system and increase the likelihood of members receiving full benefits. They offer a known and accessible capital buffer provided by investors, which replaces the uncertain covenant of the employer. This, combined with additional scheme funding, benefits of scale, and improved governance, improves the probability of members receiving their benefits in full.
In summary, the introduction of Superfunds in the DB pension sector assists both employers and members by providing a solution for managing legacy liabilities, mitigating the risk of employer insolvency, and increasing the likelihood of members receiving full benefits, especially in the context of the shift from DB to DC schemes.
