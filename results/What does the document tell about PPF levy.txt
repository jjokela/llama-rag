Prompt: What does the document tell about PPF levy?

Answer: The document mentions that the PPF (Pension Protection Fund) published the Policy statement for levy rules 2022/23 and accompanying guidance in December 2021. The policy statement refers to the similarities between schemes without a substantive sponsor (SWOSS) and commercial consolidators, such as Superfunds. The PPF has produced guidance for schemes that could fall into this category, setting out how they will calculate schemes in scope along with a bespoke levy calculation. The document also states that the PPF would expect to review these levy rules in light of the intended superfund legislation when the legislation is in force.
