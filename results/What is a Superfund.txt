Prompt: What is a Superfund?

Answer: A Superfund is an occupational pension scheme that is set up for the purpose of consolidating the liabilities of defined benefit pension schemes. It involves severing or substantially altering the link between the ceding employer and the scheme. Instead of relying on the employer's covenant, a Superfund replaces it with a capital buffer provided through external investment. This capital buffer is ringfenced within the Superfund structure. A Superfund may have multiple standalone sections with ringfenced capital requirements or it may pool all incoming schemes together. The aim of a Superfund is to attract capital into the pensions industry and improve the security of member benefits. It offers an option for employers to manage their legacy liabilities and potentially benefit the wider economy.
