pension schemes for a substantial \nproportion of their retirement income.   Although many schemes are now closed they \nhold  \u00a31.7 trillion worth of funds that I want to see working for members, employers \nand the economy and I welcome innovation in the DB landscape that will increase \nprotection for members whilst also supporting wider econom ic initiatives.  \n For sponsors for whom insurance buyout is out of reach, Superfunds have the potential to improve the likelihood of members getting their benefits in full, whilst providing employers  with a new, affordable way to manage their legacy pension  \nliabilities.  \n \nSuperfunds are also ideally placed with the benefits of scale, significant new capital \nand a well -diversified portfolio to contribute to greater investment in assets that support \nthe UK as a whole.  They align with wider Government initiatives designed to stimulate \neconomic growth and will provide access to new sources of capital investment for UK \nfirms, major infrastructure projects, other illiquid type investments, and fresh finance \nfor sustainable technology, areas which up to now have suff ered with under \ninvestment.   \n This consultation response has been developed as part of a broader collaboration with \nstakeholders across government and the pensions and insurance sector, and I am grateful for the time and thought so many have invested in this project . Work will now \nbegin to finesse the detail required to enable us to develop and progress the permanent legislative regime.  \n The vast majority of  the responses to the consultation were supportive of the proposals \nand keen to see Superfunds up, running and regulated in the UK. Setting up this \nsystem will ensure that Superfunds operate on a secure footing and support scheme \nmembers so they can confident that their position is being enhanced by this form of consolidation.    \n \nI am pleased that at least one Superfund, Clara Pensions, has met TPR\u2019s key \nexpectations but I want to see this market develop further, and soon.  I hope that \nreiterating the Government\u2019s support for Superfunds, alongside TPR\u2019s interim review, \nand committing to  having a permanent regulated regime, as soon as parliamentary \ntime allows, will help to maintain momentum and investor confidence and cement the \nlegacy of this important innovation.  \n \nThe DWP has published a number of documents today, all designed to drive better \noutcomes for pension savers. These are all part of a wider government agenda to \nimprove opportunity for investment in alternative assets including in high growth \nbusinesses and improve saver outcomes.

The defined benefit (DB) sector has changed significantly over  the years, both in \nterms of the number of schemes and members.  Most pension schemes being set up \nnow are defined contribution schemes (DC), while t he vast majority of  DB schemes \nare either  closed to new members or further  accrual . For closed schemes  the time \nhorizon until the pensions have to be paid contracts. S chemes rely on a combination \nof investment returns and support from the sponsoring employer to meet the pension \npromise and to pay the benefits  Investments do not always perform as well as \nexpected or liabilities are higher than planned for, and in these c ircumstances, \nemployers need to pay additional contributions. This relies on the employer covenant \n\u2013 the ability  and willingness  of the employer to support the scheme now, and in the \nfuture \u2013 which is far from guaranteed.  \n 2. Since the 2018 consultation the overall funding position of DB schemes has \nsubstantially improved, to the point where the  estimated  total shortfall of all schemes \nin deficit on the PPF s179 basis is now a tenth of what it was 2 years ago. However, \nwhilst  the overall funding position of DB schemes has substantially improved it remains \nvolatile. The S179 aggregate deficit was \u00a386Bn in Dec 2020, moving to a surplus of \u00a3129Bn in Dec 21 and recent market changes have created a surplus of \u00a3359.3bn as \nof Mar 23. \n 3. Whilst a ggregate scheme funding has improved markedly members benefits are \nstill at risk, even where a scheme is fully funded on the \u201cStatutory Funding Objective\u201d basis. If the employer of such a scheme were to become insolvent, it is unlikely that there would be sufficient resources in the scheme to secure full benefits for members \nwith an insurer, as sponsors are not required to fund their schemes to full insurance buyout levels. In the event of an insolvency, if the scheme has sufficient resources, it would buy out benefits at a level greater than PPF compensation, but members would still suffer a loss. This is the risk from which Superfunds can help to protect members, as they provide a better prospect of delivering full benefits than the exporting sch eme.\n \n 4. DB scheme funding has improved significantly in recent years  and is very different \nto when we consulted. Despite this the need for Superfunds still exists . Recently we \nhave seen Covid 19, changes brought about by globalisation, other significant world \nevents . The buyout market is also not fundamentally interested in schemes that cannot \nafford their products  and also has a natural ceiling to the value of schemes that can \neffect buy out in any calendar year. Buy out and Buy in volumes have averaged around \u00a325-30bn  pa over the last 5 years  and capacity is estimated by some to be circa \u00a345bn  \npa and the increases we have seen in scheme funding levels,  means the potential  \ndeman d is expected to be significantly higher than this.  \n 5. Superfunds provide a real opportunity to take significant risk to members out of the \nsystem and increas e their likelihood of receiving full benefits. A Superfund has the \npotential to get new additional funding to support  the scheme in the short term that \nmight not otherwise be available. An uncertain covenant is replaced with a known and accessible capital buffer provided by investors. The combination of additional  scheme \nfunding, capital buffer , benefits of scale and improved governance increases the \nprobability of members getting their benefits in full.

Employers, members and the wider economy will be helped by Superfunds. For \nemployers, Superfund s provide an option for  managing their legacy liabilities . There \nis an opportunity for them to draw a line under the uncertainty  and potential drag of \nlong- term legacy liabilities . Legacy DB schemes can prove to be a serious  and \nunpredictable cost burden for employers over the long term, which can be particularly \nburdensome for smaller companies. The main advantage is that once a pension scheme is moved into a Superfund, employers are freed of their obligations to the \nscheme. This allows them to then focus on their core business, potentially benefitting the wider UK economy.  \n 7. Superfunds are likely to invest in a more productive way than many closed DB \nschemes. Studies have shown that larger schemes invest in alternatives such as \ninfrastructure , property and private equity, moving away from fixed- income asse ts \nsuch as bonds.  Superfunds benefit not only from scale achieved through consolidation  \nbut through the additional support delivered by the entry price paid by the employer, \nand a significant capital buffer provided by the investors.  As with other DB schemes \nwe are not specifying the long- term objective for Superfunds . Those that choose to \nrun on for some time before securing laibiilities will be in a good position to take \nadvantage of patient capital.   Even Superfunds developed with the aim of she pherding \nschemes to the insurance market are expected to invest more productively because \nof their size, expert ise and focus on scheme management .  \n 8. Superfunds may also be able to help in situations where an employer has become \ninsolvent , but the scheme itself  is funded  above PPF levels . In the current system \nmembers in such a situation would still be likely to suffer losses  relative to full scheme \nbenefits .Very few  schemes are funded to a level which would enable them to buy out \nthe full value of member benefits in the insurance sector . In these instances members \nbenefits are compromised before being taken on by the insurer.  In these \u2018PPF+\u2019 cases, \na Superfund may be able to offer a good prospect of paying benefits in full, despite \nthere being insufficient funds to secure these benefits on the insurance market , with \nmembers continuing to enjoy the security of PPF protection.\n \n \n9. Our proposals are designed to attract billions of pounds of capital into the pensions \nindustry. Existing Superfund providers have already announced that they have \nsecured significant investment from UK and Overseas investors, and we expect this to continue as the Superfund market develops. We also expect significant sums will \nbe generated from employers and parent group companies based in the UK and \nabroad, that will be willing to pay the  significant  entry premium to release their long-\nterm pension liability. This new capital will be used to accelerate scheme funding and improve the security of member benefits.  \n 10. We believe our approach will help to ensure that the capital regime for Superfund s \nremains affordable for some employers , for whom the prospect of buying out is simply \nunaffordable now or in the foreseeable future.

We will look to develop the definition to account for DB schemes where  the ceding \nemployer\u2019s link is severed or subs tantially altered either on entry to a Superfund  or at \nsome point in the future.

The intention is that Superfunds will be authorised and supervised by TPR. \nSupervision and authorisation will include checks to ensure that Superfunds are \ncorporate bodies registered in the UK and fall under the jurisdiction of UK regulators and courts.  \n 17. A key element of the authorisation process will be a regulatory Gateway. This \ngateway will ensure pension schemes that can afford to secure members\u2019benefits with insurer s do so . Future legislation will also ensure that trustees have taken appropriate \nlegal, actuarial, investment and covenant advice when determining the suitability of consolidation into a Superfund.  \n \n18. Since June 2020 Superfunds have been governed by an interim regime overseen \nby TPR. This interim regime is currently under review and we are keen to learn any \nlessons which can be built into the permanent regime.  Further work will be required to \nestablish the processes and timeframe for Superfunds that exist under TPR\u2019s interim \nguidance to be authorised under, and transition to, the permanent regime althoug h we \nhave worked closely  with TPR on their interim regime and are confident that the \ndirection of travel  of both are well aligned. \nGovernance\n \n19. A key  principle of the Superfund  policy is to improve the likelihood that members \nwill receive full benefits and as part of this the Superfund regulatory framework needs \nto ensure that systems and processes are in place to ensure effective governance and to maximise this aim by reducing the risk inherent in the system. The bulk of our \nconsultation focussed on topics that are designed to reduce the risk of failure. As stated previously whilst a lot of the finer detail is still to be clarified there are  some \nbroad principles we can state now ; \n \n\u2022 Risk - We consider an acceptable level of risk to be a 2% chance of a scheme \nwithin a Superfund not paying full benefits  and subsequent  modelling by the \nGovernment Actuary\u2019s Department  along these lines allows for an entry price into \na Superfun d approximately 10% below the price of insurance buyout. The \nframeworks  will also need to move in a consistent manner to account for the \nchanges in the reform  of Solvency II. We will require Superfund s to have a \nmonitored risk of failure and believe that an annual assessment, which allows for an appropriate level of risk, can achieve this.  The annual assessment will be based on an appropriately prudent set of Technical Provisions (TPs) and a  1 year \n1-in-100 Value- at-Risk (VaR) capital requirement.  The success of a Superfund  \nwill be largely determined by the investment strategy and in particular level of risk being taken.

There will be a requirement for Superfunds \nto make regular public disclosures in respect of their financial position, \ngovernance, performance, and risk management. A risk management framework is needed to require commercial consolidators to demonstrate how the level of risk they are taking is proportionate, how they mitigate these risks to protect scheme members, and action to take when risk limits are breached.  \n \n\u2022 Intervention Triggers - The regime will impose intervention triggers.  The triggers \nwill control profit taking, recapitalisation/taking on new schemes, transfer of the \ncapital buffer and where necessary, enforce the wind up of a scheme or section. \nThe triggers will be based on TPs plus a multiple of the 1- in-100 VaR capital \nrequirement depending on the level of intervention, except for the winding- up \ntrigger that will be based on PPF liabilities and TPR will be provided with the required powers to intervene and enforce these triggers.  \n \n\u2022 Profit Trigger - Superfunds rely on private investors for part of their security, and \nthe investors need to be rewarded if the scheme is successful in creating value. \nBut profits can only be taken once additional value has been created, and members benefits are more secure. There will be rigorous controls on profit taking, so that members benefits are protected. The basic principle is that profit would only be taken from the scheme when the value of the assets increased by a specified margin above the initial authorisation level of funding for the scheme \u2013 \nso after an additional capital buffer providing member security had been generated. We will define the precise parameters for profit taking in Regulations, but it would be set so as not put future benefits at risk.   \n \n\u2022 T he profit trigger will be implemented only allowing extraction when assets are at \na suitably prudent level above TPs.  In cases w here a segregated model is in place, \nthe Superfund will only be able to distribute the profits from a section only after \nthat section\u2019s assets exceed TPs and a percentage over the authorisation capital requirement  or transfer of a scheme/ Superfund to an insurer occurs . Permitting \nSuperfunds to extract profit above a certain level of capitalisation allows for the commercial viability of the funds.  The profit requirement will be based on an \nassessment of the long- term sustainability of the annual balance sheet approach \nthat would allow Superfunds to pay profits on an annual basis.  Long- term \nmodelling has been used to calibrate the approach although the regime will be based on an annual assessment of funding and capitalisation.  \n \n20. The security of members\u2019 benefits will be supported not only by the absolute level \nof financial requirements, but by a ladder of intervention which will ensure these \nrequirements are supervised and enforced. In addition to the profit trigger, three further triggers will be used.  \n \n\u2022 A \u2018Level 2\u2019 trigger will be set equivalent to the authorisation level requirements for an individual section or Superfund (i.e. sufficient assets to meet TPs plus 100% of \nthe authorisation capital requirement). When funding falls below the requirements \nfor initial authorisation, the \u2018Level 2\u2019 trigger is breached. At this point the section or \nSuperfund  is unable to take on new business but will be allowed to continue to run \non. For sectionalised Superfunds, this only applies to an individual section.

Long Term Objective - Having considered the responses to the consultation \ncarefully, we do not think it would be appropriate for legislation to mandate that \nSuperfunds should be required to target buyout with an insurer. We believe this \nrequirement would threaten the viability of the Superfund market by preventing \ninnovation and variety amongst the prospective market offerings. A requirement to buyout through the bulk annuity market does not apply to the wider DB pension market and could have serious commercial implications.  \n 23. Superfunds will be expected to make their long- term objective for individual \nschemes they intend to onboard abundantly clear, so that trustees considering moving into a Superfund understand whether the transfer meets their fiduciary duties. This will \nbe part of the due diligence process, which will need to be undergone  as part of any \ngateway process.  \nFinancial Adequacy\n \n24. The financial sustainability and capital adequacy will be the most critical part of the \nnew legislative framework. Government will have to strike the right balance between improving member security, keeping the entry price affordable for employers unable to afford an insurance buyout in the foreseeable future, whilst developing a regime \ncommercially viable for providers and investors. This will be important for ensuring that Superfunds can make a sustainable contribution to achieving the Government\u2019s policy  \ngoals.  \n 25. Whilst we accept that there will be more risk in the Superfund regime than full \ninsurance buyout, the Government\u2019s current risk appetite for Superfund failure remains \nlow. The proposed Superfund regime is designed to retain an adequate level of \nprudence, albeit this will need to be maintained below the level applicable under the \nSolvency II framework for insurance companies, which provide a   fully guaranteed  \nproduct for members \u2019 pensions. This recognises a comparatively greater appetite for \nSuperfund  failure, consistent with the difference between risk profiles in pensions and \ninsurance. Whilst we accept that Superfunds are not standard DB schemes they are still pension schemes and will have their financial requirements set under a pensions regime. Whilst there are elements of the Solvency II regime that can be incorporated to reduce risk  (such as use of Value at Risk metrics)  we will not be asking schemes \nto capitalise in line with Solvenc y II.  \n  26. We therefore propose the following financial requirements under an annual \nbalance sheet approach:  \n \n\u2022 TPs based on a best estimate approach to cash- flow projection and a discount \nrate based on a prudent assessment of  the expected returns on an appropriate  \nlow risk strategy similar in nature to a \u201clow dependency investment strategy \u201d.

Many of the responses we received focussed on the extent to which our proposals \ncould bal ance three competing interests: providing security to members\u2019 benefits, \nkeeping the entry price affordable for employers, and providing a sufficient return on capital to ensure the Superfund concept is commer cially viable.    \n 31. Whilst there was broad agreement that robust authorisation and ongoing \nregulatory oversight was needed, opinion on what form this should take varied \nconsiderably.  The majority of  respondents from  the pensions  industry  argued that the \nrisks Superfunds present are best controlled by a strengthened pensions  regime.  The \nmajority of  respondents from the insurance sector wanted an insurance- based regime, \nwith some suggest ing levels of security that would only be marginally below  the \nexisting insurance buyout regime would be appropriate. \n  32. The Government considers  that a  Superfund is an occupational pension scheme . \nIf Superfunds were required  to adopt  Solvency II  capital  requirements in \ntheir entirety, we would simply be recreating insurance.  We were also clear at \nconsultation that our intention was not to simply create  a cheap form of insurance \nbuyout, that  there should be clear blue water between the two, and that e mployers \nshould never have a choice between the \u201cgold standar d\u201d for security of insurance, and \na weaker, cheaper option; where insurance buyout is achievable in the foreseeable \nfuture . We remain committed to this approach.  \n 33. In developing our proposals, we have looked closely at how effectively they deliver \nour original policy objectives. These were helping schemes and employers where \nmembers\u2019 benefits are at risk due to the risk of future employer insolvency , and where \nan insurance buyout now or in the foreseeable future is  unlikely.  The regime we are \nproposing is designed to ensure that members can have confidence in Superfunds, \nshould their pension be transferred into one in the future . We are aware that there are \ncomplex technical issues to be worked through here , so we will continue to engage \nwith stakeholders as the fine detail of the new regime  is developed.  \n 34. While  developing these proposals we have had ongoing contacts  with relevant \nGovernment Departments and Regulators  who have been informing our work. This \nhas been especially important due to the growing and developing nature of this  \nemergent market.  \n 35.

The \nrequirements set out in this consultation document set a clear direction of travel for the future legislative requirements. After a transition period, the details of which will be developed in collaboration with interested parties, Superfunds will be required to \ncomply with the legislative framework once it has come into force in order to continue to accept new transfers in.  \n 36.

The Government is keen that the ins urance \nindustry should be able to participate in the Superfund market.  They have great \nexperi ence in pensions risk transfer arrangements, and we would welcome their \nexperience, expertise and innovation.

The consultation set out a number of key differences between Superfunds and \nmore \u2018traditional\u2019 DB pension schemes based on the Superfund models that had \nstarted to emerge in the DB market. The consultation initially proposed the following \ndefining features:  \n \n\u2022 A Superfund  is, or contains, an occupational pension scheme set up for the \npurposes of effecting consolidation of DB pension schemes\u2019 liabilities;  \n\u2022 A transferring scheme\u2019s link to a ceding employer is severed or substantially altered following the transfer to or by the involvement of the Superfund;  \n\u2022 The \u2018covenant\u2019 is repla ced by a capital buffer provided through external investment \nthat sits within the Superfund  structure; and,  \n\u2022 There is a mechanism to enable returns to be payable to persons other than members or service providers.  \n 38.

It is in this context that  we believe the scope of the definition for Superfunds needs \nto be sufficiently broad  to accommodate these and any future developments  ensuring \na level playing field as solutions develop.  Expanding the scope allows us to future \nproof our definition, rather than having a narrower focus that runs the risk of becoming  \nmore  limited in use as the market develops. It would also allow us a means to consider \nhow we manage other scheme structures, such as those schemes without a substantive sponsor (SWOSS).\n \n \n41. We will continue to consider  this thinking further in time for the primary legislation \nfor Superfunds and are aware that TPR are considering these issues and plan to \npublish guidance on new models later this year.  Our intention is to have the general \nrequirement for TPR \u2019s authorisation established in the primary legislation. This would \nprobably be supplemented by carve outs  in the subsequent secondary legislation , \nwhether in part or in full, for those forms of consolidat ion or other models we do not \nthink will benefit from being regulated under TPR\u2019s Superfund regime.  \n \n42.

The consultation proposed a number of criteria (the \u201cauthorisation criteria\u201d) which \nthe Superfund would need to meet in order to become authorised.  These were that \nthe Superfund:  \n\u2022 can be effectively supervised;  \n\u2022 is run by fit and proper persons;  \n\u2022 has effective administration, governance and investment arrangements;  \n\u2022 is financially sustainable; and,  \n\u2022 has contingency plans in place to protect members.  \n \n44. While there was broad support for these criteria, a number of respondents had \nother suggestions.  \nThe Government\u2019s response  \n45.

However, it is worth noting that each section will be required \nto individually meet capital adequacy requirements, and this is discussed in greater depth below.  \nSupervisability  \nQuestions 5 & 6: Will these restrictions ensure that a Superfund can be \neffectively supervised, and should the corporate entities of Superfunds be \npermitted to be established as partnerships, or should they be required to be set up as a UK limited company?  \n46. The consultation proposed a number of requirements regarding the corporate \nstructure of Superfund s to drive transparency and ensure that Superfund models are \ncompatible with regulatory supervision. The requirements proposed were that the Superfund\u2019s corporate entity be established as a body corporate with its head off ice \nand registered office maintained in the United Kingdom. In addition, we also asked whether partnership arrangements should be permitted within a Superfund\u2019s structure.  \n 47. The vast majority of responses agreed that an entity establishing a Superfund  \nshoul d be required to be a body corporate, with its head office and registered office \nmaintained in the UK.  The main reasons for this focussed around TPR\u2019s regulatory reach and its ability to use enforcement powers.   48.

We propose to legislate  to make it a requirement that a Superf und is to be \nsupervised by TPR  if certain conditions (to be set out in secondary legislat ion) are \nsatisfied .

Since consultation HMT have also announced a review of the treatment of \nSuperfunds for tax purposes. Discussions on the detail of possible structures will need to ensure the pensions tax system applies appropriately with respect to Superfunds. \nFit and prop er \nQuestions 7 -10: Who should be subject to the f it and p roper  persons \nrequirement, its scope, and the powers TPR would need to establish that they have been met?  \n53. The main aim of the fit and proper persons requirement is to ensure that those in \na position to influence or directly impact member outcomes act with honesty, integrity and have the skills and knowledge to occupy the positions that they hold.  As part of the fit and proper persons requirement, the collective competence of both the trustee \nand executive board will also be assessed to ensure that they have the right mix of skills and knowledge appropriate to the Superfund\u2019s business model. The fit and \nproper persons requirement seek to mirror requirements under the Senior Managers \nand Certification Regime (SMCR), therefore furthering the Government\u2019s wider ambition to increase individual accountability for actions and conduct.  \n 54. The vast majority of responses were supportive of introducing some form of fit and \nproper test. A commonly raised concern centred around ensuring that any requirement captures an appropriate breadth of individuals and responsibilities which are involved with or apply to Superfunds. \nThe G overnment\u2019s response  \n55. We intend to introduce a fit and proper persons requirement in legislation  as part \nof authorisation and ongoing supervision. It is proposed that the fit and proper persons \nrequirement will mirror SMCR but be adjusted to reflect a pensions context. This will \ninclude introducing \u2018key functions\u2019 and certain \u2018prescribed responsibilities\u2019. TPR will have the power to take action should a n individual seeking  to hold a key function  not \nmeet the requirements.  \n 56.

We want to avoid introducing a process that creates barriers that do not exist \nelsewhere and will engage with industry to ensure systems replicate what already \nexists in similar schemes .

There was a clear division between respondents when answering these questions. \nThe division was most visible between industries the respondents predominantly worked in. Some respondents thought that a pensions -based funding approach was \nmost appropriate given that the pension schemes in Superfunds are classified as \noccupational pension schemes and will be regulated using pensions legislation. Concerns raised with adopting a Solvency II type approach were that it would increase the cost of  entering  a Superfund, reduce innovation and restrict the assets a \nSuperfund could invest in. This could potentially prevent invest ment  in some assets \nthat might still be suitable for long term pension liabilities and consistent  with the \nGovernments levelling up  agend a. \n 68. Conversely, some respondents highlighted the clear similarities between \nSuperfunds and insurance products. They acknowledged that to meet the policy objectives the Superfunds would need to be regulated to a lower level of security than \ninsurance companies.  However, Solvency II was considered a suitable regime, given that it is tried and tested and would allow for a direct comparison between the security offered in a Superfund  and the security provided by an insurance company.  \n 69. There was also a significant number of respondents who called for Government to \ndevelop a hybrid model based on existing pensions and insurance regimes.  \n The Government\u2019s response  \n 70. Having considered the many varied and comprehensive responses, we recognise \nthere are elements of the Solvency II framework that have been effective in managing risk in the insurance sector. We therefore propose basing the financial requirements for Superf unds on a pensions approach, drawing limited elements of the Solvency II \napproach, where these will prove beneficial to the Government\u2019s policy objectives..  \n 71. It is critical that the capital requirement for Superfunds be risk -based and not an \nabsolute or factor -based amount. We believe that capital requirements for Superfunds \nshould be proportionate to the investment, longevity, and other financial  risks taken, \nto provide a capital buffer that is consistent with Government\u2019s stated tolerance for Superfund  failure. This is also consistent with the principle of supportable risk that is \ncentral to the revised funding regime for mainstream DB which the Government recently  consulted on. This will provide a capital buffer in the event of adverse \neconomic stresses or demographic shocks. It will also match the level of resources held to the level of risk being run by the entity, which is critical for member security and avoiding excessive inappropriate risk taking.  \n 72. The total capital required will be based on a suitably prudent set of TPs and \ncalibrated to a 1- in-100 VaR over a one year period. This does not mean a Superfund  \nwould need to recapitalise every year  however there will be a need to recapitalise if \nthey fall below  the total capital required when  onboarding new schemes.

A significant number of respondents had concerns about a 99% probability of \npaying or securing members\u2019 benefits over the lifetime of the scheme. They argued this requirement was too onerous for Superfund s to be viable, commenting that it could \nbe seen as stricter than a 99.5% probability of an insurer remaining solvent over a one-year period.  \n 74. Others also claimed that this was too close to the 99.5% security offered by  \ninsurers and could lead to confusion when trying to compare the security offered in a Superfund  with that offered by an insurer.  \n 75. Another criticism of the approach was about the reliability of stochastic modelling \nfor assessing the probability of failure over the lifetime of the scheme to an acceptable degree of accuracy. Many respondents pointed out the subjectivity and sensitivity to small changes in assumptions of long term stochastic modelling.  \n The Government\u2019s response  \n 76. We looked closely at the effects of having a very low risk of failure, including \nmembers achieving full benefits. This showed that a high level of security woul d come \nat a price,  which our modelling estimates to be at 95% of current buyout pricing. Whilst \nit is clearly attractive to make the regime as secure as  possible,  we agree with the \ncomments above that a regime set very close to buyout pricing would not be viable for Superfunds to operate in. Moreover it would not meet the original policy objective of providing an alternative solution to insurance buyout. This level of security would likely \nonly be affordable to strong schemes which  we believe could afford insurance buyout \nanyway.   \n 77. Government Actuary\u2019s analysis shows typical schemes with average employer \ncovenants funded to 75% on a buyout basis, topped up by the employer\u2019s contribution to 90% funded (our estimated entry threshold) and transferred to a Super fund, could \nreduce the risk of members not receiving full benefits from 20% to less than 2%. This is a small risk and represents a much better prospect of receiving benefits in full than would have been possible in the exporting scheme.    \n 78. We have therefore decided that an estimated risk of a Superfund scheme entering \nthe PPF of  2% would represent an acceptable level of risk for the new regime. Further \nmodelling suggests that a Superfund running at this level of risk, which is within our \nrisk appetite, would cost around 90% of buyout or below.

Regarding the approach to regulation there was very little support for the \nlegislation  to require Superfunds to take a risk based long- term modelling approach \nwhen assessing the viability of a Superfund  proposal.   \nThe Government\u2019s response  \n80. We do not intend to take forward the proposal for a risk based long- term modelling \napproach for individual Superfunds.  However, we use long term modelling to inform \nour approach to a risk based capital assessment, calibrated to meet the broad \nobjectives we set out in terms of member security, affordability and commercial \nviability and when setting minimum requirements for intervention, authorisation and most importantly profit taking.  \n 81. Superfunds will have some flexibility to decide how they operate, their funding and \ninvestment strategies, and the basis on which they will accept schemes and take profits. What is set out below is a basis on which we can ensure certain minimum requirements are met in taking regulatory action or authorising new business and profit  \nextractions . We accept that by doing so we may limit the potential for innovation and \nwe consider this is acceptable when balanced against the need for adequate member protectio n.    \n 82. Schemes will have a set of regulatory Technical Provisions (TPs) to ensure \neffective provision against future financial commitments  and appropriate triggers . The \ndiscount rate used to calculate the TPs will be based on a prudent assessment  of the \nexpected investment returns that might be achieved on a suitable \u201clow risk investment \nstrategy\u201d . This may be similar in nature to the low dependency  investment strategy   as \ndiscussed in the draft Occupational Pension Schemes (Funding and Investment Strategy and Amendment) Regulations 2023. The other assumptions used to calculate \nTPs will be determined on a best estimate basis . The TPs will also include an explicit reserve for member expenses and a longevity reserve as a margin against the risk of members living longer than expected.  The longevity reserve will allow for a best \nestimate  assumption for future improvements in life expectancy broadly in line with \nTPR interim requirements.   \n 83. When we consulted in 2018 it was reasonable to have expected the discount rate \nto be of the order of gilt yields plus 0.5% pa based on market conditions at the end of December 2018..

For \nRegulatory purposes, it is envisaged that the same term structure for discount rates will be applied to all Superfunds.

This is broadly the approach we intend to take using a dynamic  basis to \nsetting expectations  based on gilt  on market conditions .  \nLong term objective  \nQuestions 24 & 30: We asked if the scheme within a Superfund should have a \nlong- term objective to buyout, and whether Superfunds should be required to \nsecure benefits with an insurance company as soon as practicable, once the \nscheme assets reach the buyout level of liabilities.  \n90. Many respondents felt that although it is a sensible objective to target an insurance \nbuyout, it should not be a legislative requirement. Some from the insurance sector did think that a legal objective to buyout would be needed, mainly to avoid arbitrage, where buyout is avoided in favour of keeping a scheme in a Superfund. \n 91. Other respondents pointed out that the aim of Superfunds is to enhance the \nsecurity of those schemes that  cannot afford to secure benefits with an insurer in the \nmedium term, and that a requirement for an objective to buyout will impair innovation and lead to sub optimal outcomes.  \n 92. The responses provided on whether Superfunds should be required to secure \ninsurance buyout once scheme assets allow, followed a similar pattern to this \ndiscussion around the long term objective.  A significant number of respondents raised \nthat it was a logical step and part of the fiduciary duties of trustees to consider securing benefits with an insurer, if the assets within the scheme were sufficient.  \nThe Government\u2019s response  \nWe accept that the emerging Superfund  market requires flexibility and space to \ninnovate, and it is crucial that consolidators do not become \u2018forced buyers\u2019 of insurance bulk annuities. As set out from paragraph 41 , like all DB schemes , each Superfund  will \nbe required to operate with a long term objective, intended to clarify the Superfund\u2019s \n\u2018endgame\u2019, and this may include a plan to gradually transfer liabilities into the bulk annuity market or look at moving to a low er risk  dependency model for investment \nstrategies. It is important that this objective is coherent and transparent to all trustees of ceding schemes, in order that they are able to properly understand the impact of consolidation on their members. Further we propose that TPR monitor  a Superfund\u2019s  \nprogress against their respective long term objectives  as part of their supervisory \napproach.  \nIntervention levels  \nMinimum funding level  \n93.

The majority of respondents were supportive of a proposal to have a failure test in \nrelation to the PPF funding level.

There were also mixed views about how to best express the trigger. \n \nThe Government\u2019s response  \n97. We propose to set the Level 1 level at or around 100% of TPs. This might be \nmarginally lower  than the level proposed in the consultation for a typical scheme. \nSome responses suggested the Level 1 trigger proposed in the consultation was set at too high a level and could discourage potential investors.

The consultation proposed a Level 2 funding level trigger to prevent a Superfund  \nfrom acquiring new schemes if it no longer meets the funding level requirements for authorisation. In these circumstances the Superfund would remain authorised to run \non with existing schemes, subject to the minimum and Level 1 funding level triggers not also being breached. As previously mentioned, if a Superfund manages to return \nto the authorisation funding level it will then be allowed to resume taking on new business  \n 99. We received a range of responses with some respondents agreeing that Level 2 \nwas sensible for the protection of beneficiaries. However, a number of respondents argued that this decision should be left to the Superfund trustees.  \n 100. Again, a reiteration of trust law and guidance from TPR will be important for \ntrustees in this position and could help to self -police this area.

On balance, we propose to set the Level 2 trigger at TPs plus 100% of the \nauthorisation capital requirement. This would  mean that if the Superfund  is below this \nfunding level it will not be able to take on new schemes. This authorisation capital requirement would be broadly equivalent to a 1- in-100 VaR measure over one year.  \nProfit trigger: A trigger to allow when profit can be taken either by investors or members.  \nQuestions 42, 43 & 44: We asked several questions around the requirements for profit extraction.  \n \n102. We received a mix of responses, with some respondents arguing that profit \nshouldn\u2019t be taken until after benefits had been secured with an insurer. Others took a more flexible view that consolidators should be able to propose their own rules for future profit extraction and that this should form part of the authorisation process.  \n 103.

Many respondents were keen to point out that the primary aim of the Superfund  \nwas to improve the probability of members receiving full benefits.  \n 105. Regarding the temporary retention of profits to mitigate against extraction due to \nmarket volatility rather than genuine outperformance, many respondents were supportive of such a restriction. However, the argument was raised that rather than setting a fix ed period to retain profits, Superfunds should be required to extract profits \nin a sustainable manner.   \nThe Government\u2019s response  \n106. We agree that member\u2019s interests must come first, whilst acknowledging that the \nSuperfund must be able to attract the investors needed to provide the external capital. \nWe propose that a Superfund may draw profits prior to securing buyout with an \ninsurance company, but only after funding levels surpass the \u2018profit trigger\u2019, set at an appropriately high level as to mitigate against the risk of value extraction at a level that may put members\u2019 benefits at risk. The profit trigger will therefore be set at a suitably prudent level above TPs . Once scheme funding is beyond this level, the Superfund  \nwill be able to extract profits.  \n 107. In response to the discussion around temporary retention of profits after reaching \nthe trigger, we agree that it is a reasonable safeguard against market volatility and will continue to work through the detail of how such a restriction would apply in practice.   \n 108. We are also aware of concerns around \u2018disguised\u2019 profit extraction, through \nexcessive expenses or charges levied by a Superfund  against scheme assets or the \ncapital buffer. The following section provides more detail on the careful supervision of this fo rm of value extraction.  \nExpenses  \n109. In exchange for the provision of services, Superfunds may need to levy fees and \ncharges on a scheme and/or capital buffer. We envisage that the future Superfund  \nregime with regard to fees and charges, will expand on the existing TPR guidance for Superfunds prior to permanent legislation. The Regulator's guidance places a series of expectations on the corporate entities managing Superfunds around value extraction, whilst not setting a prescriptive limit or cap on the acceptable level of fees and charges levied against a scheme. This is because of the wide variety of models that we anticipate entering the Superfund  market in both size and complexity, and the \nadditional expectations placed on Superfunds relative to the wider Defined Benefit \nmarket. Therefore, we feel it would be impractical to set a fixed cap on costs at this stage.  \n 110. However, the principles for value extraction and the requirements on Superfunds \naround transparency, particularly in providing evidence of value for money on an ongoing basis, will be sufficiently comprehensive and secure as to prevent inappropriate transactions against either a scheme or capital buffer.

We also asked how should each section within a sectionalised Superfund  be \ntreated for the purposes of assessing financial adequacy and funding level triggers. \nThe responses were varied, with many pointing out that the suitability of a particular approach will depend on whether the capital buffer is sectionalised, or whether there are cross subsidies between schemes from the capital buffer.  \nThe Government\u2019s response  \n122. Having considered the responses we consider that  on balance each Superfund  \nshould be authorised as a single entity. Where a Superfund is sectionalised, the \nrequirements on capital adequacy, capital buffers, intervention and profit triggers will \nbe applied to individual sections.\n  When a particular section breaches the funding \ntriggers, this section will be treated in isolation, in terms of any regulatory action that might be required, or to be individually wound- up.

We asked about the suitability of a proposed approach to ring fence the assets \nin the capital buffer instead of transferring them into the scheme as the deficits emerge. Although some respondents felt this was an adequate arrangement, there were others who felt this was too restrictive to attract investment or did not provide enough protection to member benefits.  \n 124. We received a range of responses suggesting suitable minimum requirements \non a buffer fund, in order for a scheme to be able to rely upon the assets being available in the event they are needed. The common theme in those responses was that the buffer should be structured in a way that ensures trustees can access the funds when required. However, some pointed out that mitigations should be put in place to discourage excessive risk taking, i.e. stressing the value of assets depending on the nature of risk they pose. This would incentivise appropriate risk -taking.  \n The Government\u2019s response  \n 125.

We intend to require Superfunds to demonstrate that the approach they have \ntaken to satisfy the capital adequacy requirements, including that the modelling they have undertaken is appropriate.  For initial authorisation Superfunds will need to demonstrate to TPR that the models they are using are fit for purpose, robust and capable of accurately measuring and monitoring risks that the scheme is exposed to.   \nSupervision \nReporting  \nQuestion 53: Should there be any other reporting requirements of either the corporate entity or pension scheme to ensure effective supervision?  \n129. There was a consensus in responses around the adequacy of the proposed \nreporting requirements, with broad support for quarterly valuation updates with formal \nannual valuations. Some respondents suggested that further requirements may be necessary, and that TPR should keep it \u2018under review\u2019 and update if necessary to ensure the appropriateness of the supervisory regime.  \nQuestion 54: Should the corporate entity and pension scheme have to disclose \ntheir strategic asset allocation and investment risk limits so that TPR can effectively supervise the investment strategy?  \n130. Nearly all respondents were of the view that the corporate entity and pensio n \nscheme should disclose this information, to enable effective supervision from TPR. It was flagged that this is particularly important in monitoring and ensuring transparency \naround the capital buffer.  \nQuestion 55: Should Superfunds be required to regular ly publish publicly \navailable material on their financial position and operations?  \n131.

The quarterly funding \nupdates will need to be submitted to TPR routinely, as well as in scenarios where they are required as part of any significant event or upon request by the regulator, at which point the update must be completed within an appropriate period of time agreed with  \nTPR\n.

We would like the events consulted on in Table 1, to be considered as \u2018significant \nevents\u2019 , with a requirement on the governing board or trustees to report the event to \nTPR as soon as reasonably practicable. We will work with those with experience of \nthe interim regime to ensure they are correctly specified and to consider any new \nsignificant areas that have emerged.  \nQuestion 57: How could we define \u2018significant deterioration\u2019 in relation to investment performance and funding level? \n144. There was a spread of views in response to this question. A consensus was \nformed behind the view that the funding level is the important consideration and that \ninvestment performance is less significant, particularly given that negative investment returns may be matched by falls in the value of liabilities, and therefore investment performanc e does not adequately measure benefit security. A number of respondents \nargued that \u2018significant deterioration\u2019 should be defined for each consolidator on a case- by-case basis, and should be agreed with TPR at authorisation. Their argument \nfollowed that tolerance of funding level fluctuation will vary depending on the capital backing of the consolidator and the level of risk it is pursuing. In contrast, a number of respondents argued for an absolute definition or measure, such as a deterioration in funding by 5% over a quarter. A spectrum of tolerance levels and timescales through \nwhich to measure change were floated in response.  \nThe Government\u2019s response  \n145. The Government has considered the contrasting responses around defining \n'significant deterioration', and would agree that funding level is the more important \nmetric in identifying potential issues, as investment underperformance can often be matched by a drop in liability value or the Superfund may  have a material surplus , \nthereby not affecting the ability of the Superfund  to meet the necessary benefit \npayments. However, we recognise that investment performance is a useful metric in itself, as it is often easier to track than the funding level, and where liability value is unchanged, investment performance may indicate a reduced pool of funds available to cover such benefits  or emerging problems with particular assets held.  \n 146. It is important to note that the tolerance of a Superfund  for deterioration in the \nfunding level and/or investment portfolio, will be significantly influenced by the level of risk being pursued. It therefore makes sense to link any deterioration to its impact on the capital requirement of the Superfund, and in particular, the impact of a deterioration in increasing the likelihood of regulatory intervention in the short term. Accordingly, we intend to focus on the reduction in risk capital held, measured against the capital that is required, to determine the significance of a deterioration. To decide what constitutes a tolerable reduction in risk capital, we will carefully balance the need for security against the danger of overburdening the regulator with significant events due to an excessively cautious risk tole rance.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3147, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "25dddc00-3ee4-4fba-b8af-1123f41cd527": {"__data__": {"id_": "25dddc00-3ee4-4fba-b8af-1123f41cd527", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "reduced_consolidation-of-defined-benefit-pension-schemes-response.pdf", "file_path": "docs\\reduced_consolidation-of-defined-benefit-pension-schemes-response.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 533166, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d6bfb8ae-c486-45ce-9f6a-90abe8c6c93b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "reduced_consolidation-of-defined-benefit-pension-schemes-response.pdf", "file_path": "docs\\reduced_consolidation-of-defined-benefit-pension-schemes-response.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 533166, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-14"}, "hash": "9c8f8ddd5ed137c441921ad3440a6f12ee2a121c3ef207757889311711f77157", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "50e05613-7106-4248-b869-7f0b79636a9b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "reduced_consolidation-of-defined-benefit-pension-schemes-response.pdf", "file_path": "docs\\reduced_consolidation-of-defined-benefit-pension-schemes-response.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 533166, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-14"}, "hash": "a9f0531cc055bc97687a4cb05a0eabf07f7108c5e9524f0e1919fce15152e6eb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "13b4f420-4d89-45aa-af2f-96ce0fde755f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b1fa8cd2413b761ecf55980a4780f86134c1862b3bcee2c514cf2fa18fedfb47", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "46773b0b3a83da1188ba6620e21e5d586a18bae47b51b14b268ef5b427e27351", "text": "36 \n 147.

Respondents\u2019 views on the need for a gateway differed.  Some thought that \ntrustees\u2019 fiduciary duty was a sufficient safeguard against the risk of inappropriate transactions. \n \n 159. Others thought greater protection was needed, arguing for a strong gateway with \nclearer principles that explicitly includes an assessment of the ability of the employer to fund the scheme to buyout.  \n  160. The Work and Pensions Select Committee gave support to the policy objective \nof the gateway.  \n 161. Among those who accepted the need for a ga teway there was broad support for \na qualitative or \u2018principles based\u2019 approach. Respondents argued that the decision would depend on a variety of issues, varying from case to case, and attempting to characterise these in advance could have unintended consequences. One pointed out that the pensions industry is accustomed to operating on this basis. Moral hazard was raised as a concern as, it was argued, \u2018hard coding\u2019 could create an incentive for employers to underfund schemes to meet a specified gateway thr eshold.  \nThe Government\u2019s response  \n162. After reviewing the evidence and responses to the consultation, the Government \nagrees that  a gateway is a sensible  measure to mitigate the risks respondents raised \naround the potential for regulatory arbitrage. Some respondents raised concerns that employers may see Superfunds as a way to inappropriately relinquish their \nresponsibilities at a lower cost than insurance buyout, and may put pressure on trustees to transfer into a Superfund where a more secure solution for members could \nbe found. The Government has been clear throughout the development of this policy that we are not looking for Superfunds to  be an option for schemes that  can reach \nbuyout unaided; the gateway process will be in addition to trustees\u2019 existing fiduciary duties and is designed to ensure that schemes that can afford to secure members\u2019 benefits with insurers do so.  \n 163. The Government is of the view that such a  gateway should be principles based. \nIt needs to provide a balance between recognition of market dynamics and certainty for schemes.

Trustees have an existing duty to safeguard \nscheme members\u2019 interests and the gateway will assist trustees in performing this duty by ensuring that the scheme\u2019s employer covenant is thoroughly evaluated.  In October 2020, TPR p ublished more detailed guidance on a principle based Superfund  Gateway \nfor ceding trustees and employers and we aim to develop the policy further with stakeholders, with the results to be included future legislation.\n2 \n 164. The Gateway process should be thorough but operate flexibly so as not to be \nprohibitive to potential entrants.  We are aware that TPR will be shortly updating their \nguidance on operating Gateway and are supportive of the approach they are taking including flexibilities in timing for the Gateway tests.  We would expect  employers and \ntrustees to be working together and sharing information with TPR when needed.    \n165. There was limited agreement about how \u2018foreseeable future\u2019 could best be \ndefined and no consensus around the use of five years as a benchmark. Many \nstakeholders from the pensions industry highlighted the difficulty of arriving at a \ndefinitive period. This was mainly due to a 5 year period being inappropriate for \nschemes with weaker covenants and the uncertain costs of buyout pricing in future. In opposition to this others thought that it was perfectly possible to determine funding over a 5, 10 or whatever level of funding over a given period. Few were persuaded by a shorter time period. \nThe Government\u2019s response  \n166. While the Government recognises the difficulty that accurate prediction often \nrepresents, five years is in keeping with normal business planning cyc les. The \nGovernment feels that experience should be allowed to inform the approach and consider how best to define the term in legislation.  \n 167. Although views differed among respondents, the Government was persuaded \nthat the capital requirement would constrain the level at which schemes can enter the market. It is therefore our view that a minimum funding\n level need not be set.  \nCovenant advice  \nQuestions 68 and 69: Whether external covenant advice should be a mandatory, and, if so how should those providing it be regulated.  \n168. A majority of respondents felt that covenant advice should be mandatory in every \ncase but a significant minority favoured a \u2018comply or explain\u2019 approach, with exceptions made where further advice is deemed disproportionate or unnecessary.

Some argued that since covenant advice ranged across a \nnumber of disciplines firms should be free to combine them as they saw fit.   \nThe Government\u2019s response  \n169. Ultimately the decision to enter a Superfund will remain with trustees. This group \nare the best placed to make the decision; as well as having a close understanding of their employers\u2019 affairs, they have a number of legal duties, including their fiduciary duties. We listened to concerns expressed by  some respondents about the lack of \nappropriate expertise among this group and the risk of employers exerting undue influence. However, we feel that impartial professional advice, provided in confidence, can mitigate this risk. We will require trustees to seek an expert recommendation, or demonstrate that (particularly with smaller schemes) the cost is disproportionate.  We propose that trustees seek legal advice, including advice on possible conflicts of interest and whether they have the power to make the transfer.\n  \n 170.  In addition to seeking legal advice, trustees will be expected to obtain advice \nfrom appropriately qualified and experienced covenant, actuarial, investment and risk transfer professionals. Trustees will be required to make a submission to TP R which \nintegrates the various forms of advice received, and has informed the trustees\u2019 conclusion that their scheme is better suited to entering a Superfund . This submission \nwill document the reasoning and evidence of advisers, behind the recommendations made. At present, TPR expects clearance applications for all transfers to a Superfund. \nLegislation will give TPR the ability to define the nature of a submission for transfer to a Superfund and take a risk based approach to their supervision.  \n 171. The Government recognises that, in the case of covenant practitioners, there is \nno single regulatory or professional body governing the practice, and it would be unnecessary to introduce further accreditation at this stage. However, covenant practitioners will be required to set out their suitability (professional expertise and experience) as part of the submission to TPR. It will also be the responsibility of trustees to ensure the appropriateness of the advisers whose recommendations are sought. Whilst schemes are li kely to seek in -house advice from lawyers and a scheme \nactuary, it is expected that covenant practitioners will be independent from the sponsor   \nand any exception must be explained by trustees to TPR. Advisers will be required to set out any possible conflicts of interest with the ceding employer or prospective Superfund , in the submission to TPR.  \n 172. In forming a recommendation on the suitability of a scheme to transfer into a \nSuperfund , covenant practitioners are expected to give due consideration to a range \nof information (which must be openly provided by the ceding employer and trustees), and TPR\u2019s existing guidance on assessing the employer covenant sets this out in detail.\n3  In particular but not limited to the following, covenant practitioners will assess  \nin the context of the schemes current funding position : \n \n \n3 https://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/en/document -library/regulatory -guidance/assessing- and-\nmonitoring- the-employer -covenant", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3297, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e62c2cb7-308c-4c48-b8cb-7b641ca87c9a": {"__data__": {"id_": "e62c2cb7-308c-4c48-b8cb-7b641ca87c9a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "reduced_consolidation-of-defined-benefit-pension-schemes-response.pdf", "file_path": "docs\\reduced_consolidation-of-defined-benefit-pension-schemes-response.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 533166, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3e3ca3a5-b0ad-400a-9003-95578045ef72", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "reduced_consolidation-of-defined-benefit-pension-schemes-response.pdf", "file_path": "docs\\reduced_consolidation-of-defined-benefit-pension-schemes-response.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 533166, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-14"}, "hash": "10e05ea6cde7375598934746ac70af09efc90554d231aee906890854df38f7df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2fc516c0-a70f-4eda-95ce-d6f2d9e6bcfd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "reduced_consolidation-of-defined-benefit-pension-schemes-response.pdf", "file_path": "docs\\reduced_consolidation-of-defined-benefit-pension-schemes-response.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 533166, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-14"}, "hash": "3c91e84a439f3de680058de5081dd44f344980e63bb5aa1b22c712076b8debd5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2b65e53c-4d7e-4110-aaee-fb29fd05350e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "05287b01c97045f83a35b68fcca0db7e158328c5c8dc33522ea79c7ada4c1dce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "178745ef609f34ac2574b08426d3fb536f0207ae81820b674289c3ac347f046d", "text": "41 \n \u2022 any deficit -reduction contributions  due; and, \n\u2022 the employer\u2019s ability to support the scheme now and for the foreseeable future, \nincluding assessments of the employer\u2019s prospects and affordability ; \n \n173.

We will continue to explore the supervision of covenant advice and the gateway \nprinciples of a Superfund transfer as we develop our proposals prior to legislating.  \nBulk transfer  \n175. It was proposed that the corporate entity of the Superfund would become the \nstatutory employer for the transferring scheme, and would therefore be able to receive \na bulk transfer from a ceding employer. We envisaged that the benefits payable under \nthe Superfund  trust deed and rules will be the same as the benefits payable in the \ntransferring scheme.  \n \n176. Members\u2019 (including deferred members) benefits can be transferred without \nconsent provided the transfer satisfies criteria set out in regulation 12 of the Occupational Pension Schemes (Preservation of Benefit) Regulations 1991 (and for contracted- out right s, Regulations 4 and 9 of the Contracting Out (Transfer and \nTransfer Payment) Regulations 1996). This includes gaining a certification from the scheme actuary which certifies, among other things, that the transfer credits to be acquired for each member in the Superfund  for the categories of member covered by \nthe certificate are, broadly, no less favourable than the rights to be transferred. It also requires (Regulation 12 (4B)) that members be notified.  \nQuestion 70: Should current \u2018bulk transfer\u2019 legislation apply to transfers to a Superfund?  \n177. There was almost universal agreement that the existing Bulk Transfer regulations \nshould apply although several respondents argued that they were not designed with Superfunds in mind and could be adapted to better reflect the impact of the new model. Some respondents took the view that the relationship between the ceding and receiving employer was an artificial one and the law could be changed to remove this.  \nThe Government\u2019s response  \n178. The Government feel that the existing bulk transfer regulations are sufficient \nprotection for members. While we acknowledge the issues identified by respondents, we believe additional legislation at this stage would be disproportionate.  \n 179.

Although a number of responses argued that the decision to transfer into a \nSuperfund  should ultimately remain in the hands of trustees, there was general \nconsensus that TPR should have some role in the process.  There were a number of divergent views on what form that role should take.  Some responses preferred a \u2018light -\ntouch\u2019 regime based on TPR not objecting to a transfer, others preferred a more stringent regime based on TPR \u2018approving\u2019 a transfer.  \nThe Government\u2019s response  \n181. The regulation of Superfunds needs to ensure members, the PPF and the wider \neconomy are protected. TPR supervision of any potential  gateway transaction will be \nessential to the success of the proposition. Our view is that TPR should assess \ntransactions on a risk basis, giving more detailed scrutiny to transactions where there is uncertainty over the appropriateness of a transfer into a Superfund. We intend to \nprovide TPR with suitable regulatory powers in this area.  \nQuestion 73: What further powers should TPR be given to allow it to regulate effectively both Superfunds and transfers to Superfunds?  \n182.

Many respondents were content with TPR as the regulator for Superfunds, but \nsome concern was expressed about resourcing for them.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s response  \n185. The Government recognises the need to provide TPR with greater resources and \nso an authorisation fee will be levied against Superfunds to help fund these additional \nrequirements.  The challenges posed by regulating Superfunds continue to be \nmitigated through TPR\u2019s interim guidance, and a future regulatory regime will expand and strengthen TPR\u2019s ability to regulate this emerging market. We will work with TPR and other relevant stakeholders to ascertain where this authorisation fee will be set and what resources they will need to cover this work.  \nOther live issues  \nOther forms of consolidation \n186. Since consultation in December 2018 TPR have launched an interim regime \n(June 2020). We will need to consider any transitional arrangements for any \nSuperfunds operating under this interim regime but we are confident that the direction \nfor legislation and TPRs interim regime are well aligned and continue to work closely \nwith TPR.  \n 187. In the 2018 consultation on Superfunds it was noted that there are a number of \nconsolidation options open to pension schemes to consider outside of Superfunds. As set out in that consultation Government set up a working group to look at how an accreditation scheme might operate for defined benefit master trusts (DB MTs).   188. Government recognised that it had more to do to help encourage existing forms \nof consolidation recognising the benefits it can bring by reducing scheme costs per member, enabling more effective investment strategies and improving governance. We set out in the consultation that we favoured an industry led accreditation scheme, setting out standards to raise awareness and promote the use of DB MTs, and which DB MTs would be able to sign up to on a voluntary basis.  \n 189. Through this working group the Government and industry have developed a \nvoluntary system of self -certification for DB MTs. This is a light touch self -reporting \nsystem for industry to use. As of October 2021 DB MT providers have been  able to \ncomplete a self -certificat e and upload them to the PLSA website. A number of DB MT \nproviders have already made use of this service and the Government hope to see this service continue to grow.  \n 190.

Industry are asked to demonstrate to PLSA that they are genuine registered \npension schemes before they can upload their document to the website. The \nGovernment is aware that this does not amount to a full system of accreditation, which would infer more formal authorisation that these documents are not currently  subject \nto. This is be made explicit within the documents themselves and it is also set out, with a clear purpose, what they are for and how they can be used. TPR are alse developing guidance for alternative capital models, including those innovating.  We will work with \nTPR and industry to ensure that the definition for a Superfund is clear while allowing a market for other capital models to develop in parallel.   \nQuestion 74: In the consultation we asked if these schemes should continue to be known as \u2018defined benefit  master trusts\u2019 or if there was a more suitable name \nto distinguish them from defined contribution master trusts.  \n192. While there were a mix of responses to this question, there was a majority \nconsensus for maintaining the use of the term \u2018defined benefit master trusts\u2019. Some argued in certain ways it could be confusing, but others pointed out that the term is recognised and established in the industry so changing it would only add confusion. \nOn the basis of the feedback received we agree that keeping the name as it is seems the most straightforward way of proceeding.  \nPPF Levy  \n193. PPF published the Policy statement for levy rules 2022/23 and accompanying  \nguidance in December 2021. The policy statement refers to the similarities between schemes without a substantive sponsor (SWOSS) and commercial consolidators, \nsuch as Superfunds. An active decision was taken to group both SWO SS and \ncommercial consolidators into a single appendix, Alternative Covenant Schemes (ACS). PPF have produced guidance for schemes that could fall into this category, setting out how they will calculate schemes in scope along with a bespoke levy calculatio n. In their guidance they reference TPR\u2019s Interim guidance for DB \nSuperfunds and state that any scheme on the interim regime would fall into the ACS appendix. As a result of the feedback they received during consultation, PPF have made some amendments to rule C5. We would expect the PPF to review these levy rules in light of the intended superfund legislation when the legislation is in force.  \nPPF assessment cases  \n194. Some respondents to the consultation suggested that Superfunds could offer an \nalternative option for schemes coming out of a PPF assessment period. Currently some schemes in this situation have to secure reduced benefits with an insurer following a wind -up event.  \n 195. We want to enable trustees to have the flexibility to make decisions that are in \ntheir members\u2019 best interests. This includes allowing PPF assessment cases to transfer to a Superfund  where its likely to result in a material improvement in the level \nof benefits members may receive  compared to under the PPF  or what they can", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3044, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "82da0bdc-568a-4808-a2ef-f3a0510e6a17": {"__data__": {"id_": "82da0bdc-568a-4808-a2ef-f3a0510e6a17", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "reduced_consolidation-of-defined-benefit-pension-schemes-response.pdf", "file_path": "docs\\reduced_consolidation-of-defined-benefit-pension-schemes-response.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 533166, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "07ede16f-3431-4b03-9d3b-1ee452c1b363", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "reduced_consolidation-of-defined-benefit-pension-schemes-response.pdf", "file_path": "docs\\reduced_consolidation-of-defined-benefit-pension-schemes-response.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 533166, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-14"}, "hash": "a5201992fdc6dc90794ec8d113270f69dcfacbc05f00c3e30f009bbf3aeef637", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ce064e2b-a248-44c5-a17b-39c667f387d7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "reduced_consolidation-of-defined-benefit-pension-schemes-response.pdf", "file_path": "docs\\reduced_consolidation-of-defined-benefit-pension-schemes-response.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 533166, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-14"}, "hash": "5c7b0a91ec8886489a278e847736916427eae774ceed22d20941d7b554d5496c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f3c66a1e-ba9b-4cc2-a9b9-6af3c808b275", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "01e1a6464e32a1b9d426f5df4da54e13cdc6766f63f4bfc09972576ac8bd9fdd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "316d8a3639e9fb1a4608a92b3db348e14d06de9f2d73df253f08c2688145964e", "text": "45 \n purchase in the buy out market on leaving assessment.  We are aware that there are \ncurrently some legislative restrictions that prevent these types of transfer taking place \nand we will consider the changes that may be required  to facilitat e these transfers \nmoving forward.  Ultimately this will be a decision for trustees, who having considered the gateway principles, will decide whether they should transfer to a Superfund with \nan increased likelihood of benefits being paid in full or buying out with an insurer at a lower level of benefits.  \n 196. We will also consider whether it would be beneficial to enable schemes in this \nscenario that cannot secure full benefits with an insurer or Superfund to be able to reduce member benefits to enable a Superfund transfer, but at a higher level of benefits than the buy out market can offer. This has the potential to improve member outcomes and see members transferred to a safe and highly regulated vehicle.  \nWho should regulate Superfund s? \n197. A number of respondents questioned whether the PRA would be better placed to \nregulate Superfunds.  In addition, one response argued that the Government should create a new regulator specifically for Superfunds.  The Government has been clear that Superfunds are occupational pension schemes, and should therefore be \nregulated by TPR.  Nevertheless, the Government recognises that Superfunds, as an \nentirely new form of occupational pension provision, present different challenges to established methods. We have therefore looked closely at what we can learn from other regulatory regimes, in particular the way the PRA regulates the insurance sector and this is reflected in the proposed regulatory regime. TPR will work closely with other regulators as the superfund market develops, and we will consider and look to codify these regulatory relationships as necessary  \nNext steps  \n198. As highlighted in the consultation, many of the changes outlined in this response \nwill require primary legislation.  The Government will look to bring forward legislation \nas soon as parliamentary time allows.  TPR has issued guidance to Superfunds looking to enter the DB market as well as to employers and trustees considering a Superfund  transfer. One Superfund, Clara, has already met TPR\u2019s interim guidance \nand is able to transact with ceding schemes . The Government strongly recommends \nthat the relevant parties read this guidance carefully  and come to market when they \nare ready to . \n 199. It is intended the primary legislation will provide for a new compulsory framework \napplicable to Superfunds and other relevant models of consolidation.

after contributing to a \nparticular pension scheme.  \nBridge to buyout (BTBO) \u2013  In the context of Superfunds this refers to the means by \nwhich they intend to aim for insurance buyout at the appropriate juncture.  \n   \nBuyout Basis \u2013 The buyout  valuation estimates  how much money the scheme would \nneed to buy all the accrued benefits from an insurance company.   \n Capital buffer  \u2013 In the context of Superfunds the money ringfenced  by the employer \nand investors to replace the covenant for the scheme.  \n Capital requirements  \u2013 The level of capital required for a pension scheme to be able \nto secure entry into a Superfund . \nClosed scheme \u2013 A scheme which no longer  admits new members  or has future \naccrual .  \nCovenant  \u2013 The obligation, ability , and willingness  of the employer to support  the \nscheme and protect against both short -term and long- term risks.  \nDefined benefit pension schemes  - Also known as a Final Salary  or

They pay a retirement income based on your salary and how long you have worked for your employer.  \n Employer \u2013 Most often the employer who provide a pension scheme for their staff. \nWith DB schemes they are responsible for ensuring that the funding for their pension schemes meet the level of benefits as promised in the pension scheme.  \nFiduciary duty  \u2013 A legal obligation of one party to act in the best interest of another. \nThe obligated party is typically a fiduciary, that is  in the case of pensions where \nTrustees are obligated to act in the best interest of members of the scheme(s) they are responsible for.

The target schemes for Superfunds are based on their funding levels before any capital injection from the employer group and other factors, such as the scheme size and its employer covenant.\n\nFunding Level Categorization for Scheme Eligibility:\n\n95-100% Buyout Funding Level: Schemes close to a full buyout are not expected to be part of Superfunds.\n90-95% Funding: Schemes with uncertain or no employer covenant are not considered suitable for Superfund transfer.\n70-90% Funding: These are viewed as the most suitable for Superfund transfer, potentially benefiting from risk removal but still facing solvency risk. They are likely to be able to afford the cost of entering a Superfund.\nUp to 70% Funding: Schemes below 70% are seen as possibly too challenging to reach due to the need for increased funding and premiums.\nConsiderations on Scheme Size:\n\nThe initial target for Superfunds will likely be larger, viable schemes due to the nature of commercial consolidators. There's an acknowledgment that while the preference is to also aid smaller schemes, it's improbable that Superfunds will target very small schemes from the beginning. However, this does not exclude the possibility of helping them in the future.\nRegulatory Framework and Superfund Success:\n\nIt's highlighted that a suitable regulatory framework is crucial for Superfunds to achieve the necessary scale for success.\nA restrictive regime may limit Superfunds to a small fraction of well-funded schemes, which could reduce the effectiveness of the Superfund model.\nThe page suggests a strategic approach to integrating schemes into Superfunds, taking into account their funding levels, the size of the schemes, and the importance of a flexible regulatory environment to foster success.\nPAGE 9\nResumption of Business: Superfunds can resume normal business once they return to required authorization funding levels.\n\nLevel 1 Trigger: This is activated if funding and capitalization fall below a certain level. Remaining funds within the Superfund or a specific section may be tipped into the scheme funder, with control of the funds being completely handed over to the Superfund Trustees. This allows the section or Superfund to operate independently of a substantive sponsor or transfer liabilities elsewhere if possible.\n\nWind-up Trigger: Determined by a PPF (Pension Protection Fund) valuation, the wind-up trigger is set above PPF level benefits to protect members from losing some of their pension promises if they receive compensation from the PPF. This trigger allows for flexibility and amendments with the agreement of TPR (The Pensions Regulator), similar to TPR's current interim guidance.\n\nSuperfund Corrective Actions: Superfunds have the opportunity within certain limits to take corrective action if triggers are breached. The document discusses intervention and profit triggers, which are detailed from paragraph 105 onwards.\n\nLadders of Intervention Diagram: A visual representation showing different levels of intervention based on the Superfund's funding status.\n\nProfit Trigger: Occurs when funding is between 125-150% of Authorization Capital Requirements.\nLevel 2: Activated when funding equals 100% of authorization capital requirements.\nLevel 1: Represents Technical Provisions (TPs).\nThe base level indicates a trigger for PPF wind-up at 105% of s179 valuation.\nThis section of the document is clearly focused on the financial health of Superfunds and the mechanisms in place to ensure they are operated within defined funding thresholds to protect the interests of pension holders.\nPAGE 11\nConsultation Overview (Paragraph 27):\n\nOn December 7, 2018, a consultation titled \"Consolidation of Defined Benefit Schemes\" was published to outline the operational approach for Superfunds and seek feedback on its practicalities.\nA total of 60 responses were received from various organizations and individuals, showing significant interest in the consolidation model within the UK.\nThree industry roundtables were held to discuss entry requirements for Superfunds, governance, and financial sustainability.\nResponses and Attendees (Paragraph 28):\n\nThe organizations that participated in the roundtables are listed in Annex A of the document.\nThe contributions to the debate were appreciated for both their quantity and quality.\nMost respondents acknowledged the potential benefits that Superfunds could bring and the necessity for specific legislation to ensure safe operation.\nRespondents by Type (Figure 1):\n\nA pie chart illustrates the distribution of respondents by type:\nFinancial Services (30%)\nLegal (25%)\nPension Provider (17%)\nInsurance Provider (7%)\nActuarial, Consultancy, Individual, Other, and Trade Union each at 5%\nPost-Consultation Actions (Paragraph 29):\n\nAfter the consultation, there was close collaboration with stakeholders from government and the pension and insurance industries to develop a regulatory and authorization regime.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5135, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"},

(7%)\nActuarial, Consultancy, Individual, Other, and Trade Union each at 5%\nPost-Consultation Actions (Paragraph 29):\n\nAfter the consultation, there was close collaboration with stakeholders from government and the pension and insurance industries to develop a regulatory and authorization regime.\nDiscussions primarily focused on:\nThe size of the capital buffer needed to replace the employer covenant and protect members' benefits.\nThe rules governing the control of investment risk.\nThis page highlights the collaborative efforts between various industry players and the government to shape the regulatory environment for Superfunds, emphasizing the need for a robust framework to ensure member benefits and manage investment risks effectively.\nPAGE 34\nTable 1 - Significant Events Affecting Superfunds\n\nA change to an individual subject to the fit and proper persons requirement:\n\nInvolves appointing a person under the fit and proper criteria at the point of authorization or when there's a change in circumstances for someone already subject to this requirement.\nApplies to: Corporate entity/pension scheme.\nAn investigation by another regulator or competent authority:\n\nTriggered when an investigation is launched into any aspect of the Superfund, including those outside the UK and changes in third-party service providers.\nApplies to: Corporate entity/pension scheme.\nA change to the business plan or investment strategy:\n\nAny changes needing a revision to the business plan or deviations from the investment strategy.\nApplies to: Corporate entity/pension scheme.\nA change to the statement of funding principles:\n\nAlterations in the approach to assumptions for calculating liabilities.\nApplies to: Corporate entity/pension scheme.\nA deterioration in the funding level:\n\nSignificant decline in funding level over a set time period.\nApplies to: Pension scheme.\nThe corporate entity is unable or unlikely to meet agreed levels of assets or liquidity:\n\nDeterioration in the financial reserves within the business.\nApplies to: Corporate entity.\nThe Superfund pension scheme and/or corporate entity is unable to meet its liabilities on demand:\n\nThe entity is unlikely to meet its liabilities as they fall due.\nApplies to: Corporate entity/pension scheme.\nDiscussion on the Consultation Feedback (Paragraph 142)\n\nThe majority of respondents agreed with the proposed significant events and additional suggestions, such as changes to corporate structure, as potential significant events.\nThere's a call for a simplified, more comprehensive reporting structure, to lessen the burden of excessive reporting and standardize TPR (The Pensions Regulator) flagship schemes.\nConcerns about the excessive burden of reporting and suggestions for reducing the number of reports were raised.\nIt was proposed that there needs to be clearly defined thresholds for each significant event to ensure consistent application of the framework by all consolidators.\nThis page reflects the feedback from a consultation process, indicating a consensus on defining significant events that would require regulatory reporting or action, and a recognition of the need for streamlined and consistent reporting requirements.\nPAGE 37\nRisk of Regulatory Arbitrage (Paragraph 153):\n\nA 'gateway' was proposed to regulate schemes that can afford insurance buyout to prevent regulatory arbitrage.\nThe gateway ensures that transferring into a Superfund is in the members' best interests and involves a set of clear requirements and advice that must be followed.\nGateway Principles (Paragraph 154):\n\nThe principles set out to determine Superfund eligibility exclude schemes that:\nCan buyout through an insurance provider.\nAre assessed to afford buyout in the foreseeable future.\nWould not increase the likelihood of scheme members receiving full benefits.\nAsset and Buyout Comparison (Paragraph 155):\n\nFor schemes that don't have sufficient assets for a buyout, the decision to transfer involves comparing two entities: the pension scheme and the employer covenant.\nThe comparison includes financial obligations and the likelihood of the employer's long-term ability to pay, taking into account various factors such as the sector, legal obligations, and potential group support.\nGateway Application (Paragraph 156):\n\nEntering a Superfund is recommended only if the gateway principles are met.\nA simplified flowchart outlines the decision-making process:\nIf a scheme can buyout now or in the foreseeable future, it fails the gateway test.\nIf it cannot buyout, gateway submission to TPR (The Pensions Regulator) is required.\nThe page concludes that while the flowchart provides a simplified view, the actual decision-making process is more nuanced. This indicates that the gateway serves as an initial screening tool for eligibility, but each scheme's situation will need a detailed assessment.", "start_char_idx": 4166, "end_char_idx": 9694,
